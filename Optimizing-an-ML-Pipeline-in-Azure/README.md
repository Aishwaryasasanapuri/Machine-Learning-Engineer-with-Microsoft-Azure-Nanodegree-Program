# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."** :- This Project aims at making a binary prediction to find whether customers will join a Bank or Not.This dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking sector. The campaigns were based on phone calls.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."** :- The best performing model was a Voting Ensemble of **Xgboost classifier** using standard scaler wrapper. This was found using Automl feature of Azure

Files Used to perform the Analysis are 

- Train.py
- Project.ipynb
We need to build a Machine learning model using skikit learn and tune the hyper parameters to find the best model using azure ML python SDK and Hyper Drive.
Post that we need to use the Azure AutoML Feature to find the best model and best Hyperparameters.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
**Image of cluster marked for deletion**
